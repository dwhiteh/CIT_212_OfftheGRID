            So you think you can handle living off the grid?!?! We doubt it. You have no hope. You'll get eaten by a bear! Don't believe
            us, just hover over the beautiful landscape picture to see what they are capable of!
            <br>
            <br>
            We're just kidding course. If you need to get off the grid ASAP because you are on the run from the law, or are simply
            interested in the process, we have you covered!
            <br>
