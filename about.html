            <span class="bold">1.</span> You need land. Preferably not within sight of a Walmart.<br>
            <span class="bold">2.</span> Protection from the elements. Consider if you'll be building a house, sleeping in a tent, or possibly a camper.<br>
            <span class="bold">3.</span> You'll need to hydrate. We'd recommend a LifeStraw or some other way to collect water. Be sure to take appropriate precautions to ensure water is potable.<br>
            <span class="bold">4.</span> Food. You'll need guns. Or grow a garden. Or gather wild produce. Or go to Costco every other week.<br>
            <span class="bold">5.</span> Will you require power or will you be legitimately off the grid?<br>
            <span class="bold">6.</span> If you do need power, maybe consider packing batteries to store power you have generated.<br>
            <span class="bold">7.</span> How will you deal with your waste? Hopefully, responsibly. <br>
            <span class="bold">8.</span> And finally....do you really want to do this? It is difficult and you must be committed. Consider it carefully.<br>
            <span class="bold">.....don't forget about the bears.</span>
